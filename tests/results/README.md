# Test Results

This directory contains the output JSON files generated by the AFP and baseline tests, providing performance metrics and comparisons.

## Files

- **baseline_results.json** - Performance metrics from baseline tests without AFP
- **afp_results.json** - Performance metrics from the AFP implementation tests
- **afp_comparison.json** - Direct comparison between baseline and AFP metrics
- **afp_ai_integration_results.json** - Results from integrating AFP with Azure OpenAI API

## Analysis

These result files document the performance improvements achieved by the AFP implementation:

- **Direct Communication**: AFP shows significant latency reduction and throughput improvement
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: AFP demonstrates massive throughput improvements
- **Complex Workflows**: AFP performance with added security and reliability mechanisms
- **API Integration**: Metrics on AFP integration with external services

The JSON format makes it easy to parse these results for further analysis or visualization.
