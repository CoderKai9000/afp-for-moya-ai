        "response": "Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning approach that allows models to be trained across decentralized data sources without transferring raw data to a central server. This is particularly important in healthcare settings where data privacy and security are paramount. NeuroSynth can leverage federated learning approaches to train models on hospital data while maintaining privacy. One federated learning approach that could help NeuroSynth maintain privacy while training on hospital data is Secure Aggregation.\n\nSecure Aggregation in Federated Learning:\nSecure Aggregation is a technique that ensures the privacy of data during the aggregation process in federated learning. It enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a model without revealing their individual data to others. Here's how NeuroSynth could implement Secure Aggregation in federated learning for training on hospital data:\n\n1. **Client-side Model Updates**: In a federated learning setup, hospitals or healthcare institutions act as clients that train the model on their local data.
